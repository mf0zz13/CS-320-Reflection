## How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?  
The only way to ensure that software is functional and secure is through testing. While it is impossible to test 100% of the variables, we can still effectively test a system using testing best practices. **Functional testing** will show if a system only accepts valid entries or manipulates data in the expected manner. Utilizing **nonfunctional testing** will verify that the system does not experience high latency and that the overall system will complete its expected purpose.  

## How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?  
Interpreting users’ needs is one of the most difficult parts of software development. Once the desired end that the user is hoping for is understood, **software requirements** can be drafted. From these requirements, a set of **test cases** can be developed. By writing code to pass the test cases, the developer has a much higher likelihood of writing code that correctly incorporates the users’ needs into the program.  

## How do I approach designing software?  
I like to approach designing software by making sure I have a true understanding of the end state. I believe that once I truly understand what the desired goal of the system is, I can quickly develop **requirements** and **test cases** from there. Once I have the test cases designed, I can focus on writing code that passes the test cases, and then refactor as I am able to from there.
